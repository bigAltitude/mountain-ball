# Ball Simulation Game

Welcome to the **Ball Simulation Game** – a fun physics-based simulation built with Python and Tkinter. This project showcases a bouncing ball that interacts with a randomly generated terrain, complete with dynamic hit counting, runtime tracking, and hits per minute (HPM) calculation. Plus, it’s boss-proof: you can quickly shut it down with a middle mouse click if you need to pretend you're busy!

## Features

- **Physics Simulation:** Realistic ball movement with gravity.
- **Dynamic Terrain:** Randomly generated terrain for unpredictable bounces.
- **Score Tracking:** Hit counter, runtime (in seconds), and calculated hits per minute (HPM).
- **Time Limit:** Simulation runs for 2 minutes, then stops updating so you can admire your score.
- **Quick Shutdown:** Instantly exit the game using the middle mouse button or ESC key.
- **Visual Effects:** A neat trail effect that cleans up after 5 seconds.
- **Borderless Window:** The game window is borderless and positioned at (100,200) on your screen.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** – This project uses standard Python libraries (`tkinter`, `random`, `math`, and `time`), so no extra installations are necessary.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ball-simulation-game.git
